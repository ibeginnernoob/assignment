Q1. Leveraging AI in Front-End Delivery 
“Describe, with concrete examples, how you would use AI-powered coding or 
design assistants to accelerate front-end development in a startup where 
shipping fast matters but code quality can’t slip.”

Answer:
1. AI-Powered Code Generation & Autocompletion
Example: Use GitHub Copilot or Amazon CodeWhisperer to:

Generate boilerplate React/Vue components from natural language prompts (e.g., “Create a responsive navbar with dark mode toggle”).

Auto-suggest optimizations (e.g., converting map loops to memoized components).

Catch anti-patterns (e.g., missing key props in lists) in real-time.

Impact: Reduces repetitive coding by 30–50%, letting engineers focus on complex logic.

2. AI-Assisted UI/UX Design
Example: Tools like Figma’s AI or Lovable or v0 by vercel or Uizard can:

Generate design prototypes from text prompts (e.g., “Dashboard with metrics card, sidebar, and dark theme”).

Convert hand-drawn wireframes into production-ready UI code (via tools like Anima).

Impact: Cuts design-to-code time from days to hours.

3. AI-Driven Testing & Debugging
Example: Playwright’s Test Generator records user flows and auto-generates test cases.

AI tools like Sentry predict front-end errors (e.g., hydration mismatches) before deployment.

Impact: Ensures quality without manual test-writing overhead.

4. AI for Performance Optimization
Example: Vercel’s Analytics + Lighthouse CI use AI to suggest:

Image format optimizations (e.g., switching to WebP).

Critical CSS extraction to reduce render-blocking.

Impact: Ships faster while keeping performance scores high.




Q2. Inventing an AI Feature for Class 11 Students 
“You’re tasked with designing a new AI feature that makes Physics revision 
easier for Indian class 11 students. Outline two key features and sketch the user 
journey in plain text.” 

Answer:
Feature 1: Smart Concept Maps with AI-Generated Analogies

How it Works:

Students input a topic (e.g., “Newton’s Laws”).

AI generates an interactive mind map linking subtopics (e.g., inertia → real-world examples like seatbelts).

AI Twist: Uses relatable analogies (e.g., “Momentum is like a cricket ball’s motion after a bowler’s throw”).

Feature 2: Adaptive MCQ Drill with Instant Doubt Solving

How it Works:

AI serves MCQs based on past mistakes (e.g., frequent errors in “Gravitation” → prioritizes those questions).

For incorrect answers, AI provides a 1-minute TikTok-style video explanation (e.g., whiteboard animation + voiceover).
